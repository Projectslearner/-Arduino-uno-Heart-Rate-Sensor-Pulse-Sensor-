# Arduino uno Heart Rate Sensor Pulse Sensor
The Arduino Uno Heart Rate Sensor (Pulse Sensor) measures the heart rate and blood oxygen levels by detecting changes in blood volume. It typically uses photoplethysmography (PPG) to monitor heartbeats, enabling applications in health monitoring, fitness tracking, and biofeedback systems.
