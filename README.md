# Arduino Uno Heart Rate Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a heart rate sensor with an Arduino Uno to measure the user's pulse. The sensor's analog signal is read by the Arduino and processed to detect heartbeats. The results are displayed on the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Heart Rate Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Heart Rate Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - **Vcc pin of the Heart Rate Sensor:** Connect to 5V on the Arduino Uno.
   - **GND pin of the Heart Rate Sensor:** Connect to GND on the Arduino Uno.
   - **Signal pin of the Heart Rate Sensor:** Connect to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the heart rate sensor to the Arduino Uno as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Place your finger on the heart rate sensor and observe the serial monitor output displaying the sensor values and pulse detection.

#### Applications

- **Health Monitoring:** Measure and monitor heart rate in various health applications.
- **Fitness Tracking:** Use in fitness devices to track heart rate during exercise.
- **Biofeedback:** Implement in biofeedback systems for stress and relaxation training.

#### Notes

- Ensure the heart rate sensor is correctly connected to the Arduino Uno and powered.
- The threshold value for pulse detection may need adjustment based on your specific sensor and conditions.
- Modify the code to implement additional features such as calculating beats per minute (BPM).
